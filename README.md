### R package:

* [noaastorms](https://github.com/basilesimon/noaastorms)
Get NOAA IBTrack data ready to use in R.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which releases datasets known as International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship.


* [rrricanes](https://github.com/ropensci/rrricanes)
An R library that extracts information from available archives on past and current tropical cyclones. Currently, archives date back to 1998


* [stormwindmodel](https://github.com/geanders/stormwindmodel)
model wind speeds at grid points in the United States based on “best tracks” hurricane tracking data, using a model for wind speed developed by Willoughby and coauthors (2006).


* [hurricaneexposuredata](https://github.com/geanders/hurricaneexposuredata)
hazard-based exposure data for U.S. counties for historical tropical storms in the Atlantic basin. 

* [hurricane-animation](https://github.com/savagedata/hurricane-animation)
An R script produces hurricane animations to compare forecasts with actual hurricane paths.

* [HURDAT](https://github.com/timtrice/HURDAT)
HURDAT is a dataset of best-track analysis for Atlantic and NE Pacific cyclones. This R package scrapes and parses that dataset.

### Python package:

* [tcrm](https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/tcrm)
A statistical-parametric model for assessing wind hazard from tropical cyclones


* [stormtracks](https://github.com/markmuetz/stormtracks)
Detection and Tracking of Tropical Cyclones from the C20 Reanalysis Project (20CR)


* [TCI](https://github.com/wy2136/TCI)
Calculate tropical cyclone related indices like GPI, VI, etc.


* [Typhoon_Stats](https://github.com/iamjorob/Typhoon_Stats)
Python code to estimate return period of tropical cyclone winds in the northern west pacific ocean.
